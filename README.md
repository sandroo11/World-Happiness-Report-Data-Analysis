World Happiness Report Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the World Happiness Report data, aiming to understand the factors influencing happiness across different countries. It encompasses descriptive data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive data analysis to explore and predict happiness scores based on various socio-economic indicators.

Key Findings:

GDP per capita: There exists a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores, indicating that wealthier countries tend to have higher levels of happiness among their populations.

Social Support: Strong social support systems correlate positively with higher happiness scores, underscoring the role of community and social networks in overall well-being.

Healthy Life Expectancy: Longer healthy life expectancy is positively associated with happiness, suggesting that better health contributes significantly to overall happiness.

Freedom: Countries where individuals perceive greater freedom tend to report higher happiness scores.

Generosity: While generosity shows a positive coefficient, its statistical significance at the 0.05 level is borderline, suggesting a need for further investigation.

Perceptions of Corruption: Similar to generosity, perceptions of corruption display a positive coefficient with a p-value just above 0.05, indicating a potential impact on happiness that requires deeper exploration.

Additionally, countries with picturesque natural landscapes often report higher happiness levels, hinting at the influence of natural environments on happiness.
